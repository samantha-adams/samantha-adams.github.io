For use in a React component, make a list of Constellations that can be use to determine the x and y object position of a star in relation to its constellation.

Each object in the Constellations list should have a name property, that is the name of the constellation, and a list of all stars in the constellation with the x and y coordinates for the star.

Example: 
  { name: 'Orion', stars: [
      { x: 50, y: 50 },
      { x: 55, y: 48 },
      { x: 58, y: 52 },
      // Add more stars for Orion
    ]
  },

  Be sure to include every single star within the stars list for each constellation.

  Start with just two constellations and every start within them.
